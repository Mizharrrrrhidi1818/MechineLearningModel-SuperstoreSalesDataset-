Select any dataset from a public repository: UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle Datasets, which: 
contains both numerical conditional attributes (including at least one continuous one) and categorical attributes + a decision attribute,
has missing values and outliers.

Perform a complete preprocessing of the selected dataset, including:
1.	Handling missing values,
2.	Checking and possibly removing duplicates,
3.	Detecting and handling outliers,
4.	Normalisation,
5.	Discretisation,
6.	Coding categorical variables, 
7.	Dividing the dataset into a training and test set.
8.	Check the correlations of the features
9.	Also perform a simple analysis of the distribution of the selected variable before and after preprocessing. Use graphs such as histograms or boxplots to show the changes.
10.	Create a model of machine learning, and which is the best model?

Each stage of preprocessing should be commented on appropriately. Any Python tools may be used. Each student should choose a different dataset to avoid repetition within the group.
